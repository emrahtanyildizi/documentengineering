Documents are essential in many professions, including law, banking, and technology, to name a few. The automated interpretation of papers such as invoices, contracts, and resumes represents a lucrative prospect, ushering in a slew of new business opportunities. Deep learning breakthroughs have propelled substantial strides in natural language processing and computer vision, resulting in the incorporation of these approaches into modern document understanding systems.

  - DocILE Benchmark for Document Information Localization and Extraction, Stepan Simsa, et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05658
    
This research paper introduces the DocILE benchmark, featuring the most extensive collection of business documents designed for two primary tasks: Key Information Localization and Extraction, as well as Line Item Recognition. The dataset encompasses 6.7k meticulously annotated business documents, supplemented by 100k synthetically generated documents, and an additional ~1M unlabeled documents to facilitate unsupervised pre-training. The construction of this dataset incorporates domain- and task-specific expertise, resulting in the following notable attributes:
Annotations span across 55 distinct classes, a substantial improvement in granularity compared to previously published datasets for key information extraction.
The Line Item Recognition task addresses a practical scenario where essential information must be associated with items within a table.
The documents originate from a diverse range of layouts, and the test set includes instances with zero- and few-shot cases, along with layouts commonly encountered in the training set.
The benchmark is accompanied by several baseline models, including RoBERTa, LayoutLMv3, and DETR-based Table Transformer, all applied to both tasks within the DocILE benchmark. The results of these baselines are presented in the paper, serving as a valuable starting point for future research endeavors.
