TOPIC: ""Use AI to Build Document Processing Workflows""

Problem statement - Research question:
Enterprises worldwide heavily depend on documents as a means to store and communicate vital information. Often, the transformation of this information into a digital format is essential for its utility. Nevertheless, today achieving this digitization typically involves laborious and time-consuming manual procedures. The automated interpretation of documents such as invoices, contracts, and resumes represents a profitable prospect, leading in new business opportunities. Deep learning breakthroughs have driven substantial development in natural language processing and computer vision, resulting in the incorporation of these approaches into modern document understanding systems.

QUESTION: How does the implementation of AI Document Intelligence impact the efficiency and accuracy of transforming diverse document types into usable data, considering the variations in document structures, layouts, and information relevance? How does this transformation influence enterprises' ability to shift their operational focus from data compilation to informed decision-making?

KEY BUSINESS USAGE:
* Completing medical intake forms during visits to medical facilities
* Processing expense reports utilizing receipts and invoices (service fee processing - fixed fees, capped fees, sucess-based fees)
* Verifying identity through ID card authentication
* Granting loan approvals using income details from tax forms
* Interpreting contracts relevant to significant business agreements


Methods: 
- LLM-driven document ai
- Automate enterprise document processing workflows

  - DocILE Benchmark for Document Information Localization and Extraction, Stepan Simsa, et al. 2023 -  https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05658
    
This research paper introduces the DocILE benchmark, featuring the most extensive collection of business documents designed for two primary tasks: Key Information Localization and Extraction, as well as Line Item Recognition. The dataset encompasses 6.7k meticulously annotated business documents, supplemented by 100k synthetically generated documents, and an additional ~1M unlabeled documents to facilitate unsupervised pre-training. The construction of this dataset incorporates domain- and task-specific expertise, resulting in the following notable attributes:
Annotations span across 55 distinct classes, a substantial improvement in granularity compared to previously published datasets for key information extraction.
The Line Item Recognition task addresses a practical scenario where essential information must be associated with items within a table.
The documents originate from a diverse range of layouts, and the test set includes instances with zero- and few-shot cases, along with layouts commonly encountered in the training set.
The benchmark is accompanied by several baseline models, including RoBERTa, LayoutLMv3, and DETR-based Table Transformer, all applied to both tasks within the DocILE benchmark. The results of these baselines are presented in the paper, serving as a valuable starting point for future research endeavors. 

- Business Document Information Extraction: Towards Practical Benchmarks - Matyas Skalicky, et al. 2022 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11229

Efficient business-to-business (B2B) communication heavily relies on extracting information from partially structured documents. Despite the long-standing exploration of Machine Learning challenges associated with Document Information Extraction (IE), many prevailing problem formulations and performance standards fail to encompass industry-specific nuances and the tangible requirements for automating B2B document exchange. Our assessment traverses the landscape of Document IE quandaries, datasets, and performance yardsticks. We underscore the real-world aspects that elude conventional definitions and introduce the Key Information Localization and Extraction (KILE) as well as the Line Item Recognition (LIR) predicaments. The scarcity of pertinent datasets and benchmarks for Document IE concerning semi-structured business documents stems from their customary legal or sensitive content. We delve into potential resources for accessible documents, including the prospect of synthetic data.

- Document AI: Benchmarks, Models and Applications, Lei Cui and et al. 2021 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08609
Emerging as a novel field of study, Document AI, or Document Intelligence, pertains to the realm of automating the interpretation, comprehension, and assessment of business documents. Positioned at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision, it holds significant importance. The ascent of deep learning techniques in recent times has propelled the advancement of Document AI, encompassing areas like document layout analysis, visual information extraction, document visual question answering, document image classification, and more. This document provides a succinct overview of key models, tasks, and benchmark datasets that characterize this domain. Additionally, it delves into preliminary heuristic rule-based document analysis, statistical machine learning algorithms, and primarily pre-training methodologies within the purview of deep learning. Lastly, prospective avenues for future research in the field of Document AI are contemplated.


- Efficient Automated Processing of the Unstructured Documents Using Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Literature Review and Future Directions, Dipali Baviskar and et al. - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9402739
Ninety-five percent of organizations are affected by unstructured data, resulting in annual costs amounting to millions of dollars. Skillful management of this data holds the potential to substantially enhance business productivity. Conventional information extraction methods have inherent limitations, whereas AI-powered approaches offer a more promising remedy. Surprisingly, a comprehensive exploration of AI-driven methods for autonomously extracting information from unstructured documents remains absent in existing literature. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to identify and scrutinize research concerning techniques employed in the automatic extraction of information from unstructured documents, while also charting pathways for future investigative efforts.
